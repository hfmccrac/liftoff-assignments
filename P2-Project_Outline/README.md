## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will develop an app to record meals, bathroom habits, and symptoms. It will be a food journal that provides insights to the user.
Insights such as what kind of food or a specific food may be causing problems. It will also recommend substitutions for problematic foods.
The idea came about from suffering from IBD and trying to manage my illness and reduce symptoms.
I felt most food journal apps focused more on calorie counting or weight management and not overall health or managing symptoms.
